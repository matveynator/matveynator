- 👋 Hi, I’m @matveynator
- 👀 I’m interested in problem-solving software. 
- 💞️ I like writing concurent [GO](https://go.dev) and [TinyGO](https://tinygo.org/) in accordance with all the [GO proverbs](https://go-proverbs.github.io/) invented by smart people behind GO.
- 🌱 I’m looking to collaborate on deep space and problem-solving projects.
